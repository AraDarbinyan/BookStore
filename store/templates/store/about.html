  <h2 class="mt-4">Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    Bookstore is a demo project developed by a junior Python/Django developer to demonstrate skills in web development.
    It is not a commercial site, but a functional simulation of a real e-commerce bookstore. The project includes
    key features like product management, shopping cart, checkout system, and user authentication.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project was built using <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>, and <strong>Django</strong>, with a focus on clean design,
    usability, and code quality.
